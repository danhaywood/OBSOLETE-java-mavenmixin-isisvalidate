This module, for use within link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis] applications, provides a link:https://github.com/odavid/maven-plugins[maven mixin] that can be used to run the `validate` goal of the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgmvn.html[Apache Isis maven plugin] for a domain object model.
This reduces the size of the maven `pom.xml` file for that consuming module; it simply needs to reference _this_ module using the `mixin-maven-plugin`.

The appropriate configuration is included in a `<profile>` which is automatically included in all builds.
This profile can be disabled using a Maven property.


== Input Properties

The plugin requires two properties:

[source,xml]
----
<properties>
    <isis.version>1.13.1</isis.version>                                 <!--1-->	
    <danhaywood-mavenmixin-isisvalidate.appManifest>                    <!--2-->
        domainapp.modules.simple.SimpleModuleManifest
    </danhaywood-mavenmixin-isisvalidate.appManifest>
</properties>
----
<1> the version of Apache Isis
<2> the fully qualified class name of the `AppManifest` that references the module(s) to validate.

These properties should be specified in the consuming module.



== How to Configure/Use

To use:

* add the following to the `pom.xml` of the module(s) containing the JDO/DataNucleus entities: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.github.odavid.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>mixin-maven-plugin</artifactId>

            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
----

* Specify the mandatory input properties (see above).


To disable the (profile contributed by this) mixin, pass the following system property to `mvn`:

== Maven deploy notes

The module is deployed using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide] and http://www.danhaywood.com/2013/07/11/deploying-artifacts-to-maven-central-repo/[this blog post]).

The `release.sh` script automates the release process.
It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 0.0.1 \
              0.0.2-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where

* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the ``pgp-maven-plugin``'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 0.0.1
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue before trying again.
Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the `autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).
You may want to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
