= java-mavenmixin-resourcesinjavasrcdirs


This module, intended for use within link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides a maven mixin which configures the build so that resources (eg `.layout.xml` files or `.png` image files) can be picked up from the `src/main/java` and `src/test/java` directories (as well as the usual `src/main/resources` and `src/test/resources` directories.
This reduces the size of the maven `pom.xml` files; it simply needs to reference this module.

The appropriate configuration is included in a `<profile>` which is automatically included in all builds.
This profile can be disabled using a Maven property.




== How to Configure/Use

To use:

* add the following to the `pom.xml` of the module(s) containing the JDO/DataNucleus entities: +

=== Dependencies

This mixin module relies on the link:https://github.com/odavid/maven-plugins[com.github.odavid.maven.plugins:mixin-maven-plugin], released under Apache License v2.0.



== Maven deploy notes

Only the `defn` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).


=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd mixin
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process.
It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 0.0.1 \
              0.0.2-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where

* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 0.0.1
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again. Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo). You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
